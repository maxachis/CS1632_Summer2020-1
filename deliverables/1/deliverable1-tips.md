1. Be as precise as possible.  Don't say "Ensure that you see the correct
   value"; say that "You should see the text 'A Smart door leads South'".
Don't say that you should "go north"; say "Type n <enter>".

2. Remember to put down all the necessary steps and preconditions!

3. The "Test Case" item is for a description of the test case in plain English.
   For example, "Ensure that user can go North from the starting room."

4. You do not need to exhaustively test the application!  If you find yourself
   with more than three test cases per requirement, you may be over-testing.
This is admirable in software where human life is at stake, but this is only
your grade.

5. This is a test plan, not a test run - remember the difference.  You obtain
   expected behavior from the requirements and that behavior is documented as
part of the test plan.  You obtain observed behavior every time you run the
test plan.

6. Note that if you find yourself in a magical land - even if you get transported back to where you came from - you may have gone through a door which did not exist.  Think about if that meets the requirements or not.

7. Remember that tests should be reproducible - starting with all preconditions
   met, anybody should be able to reproduce the same steps and get the same
results.  If they can't, rethink your preconditions!
