This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software
testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing theory, the
emphasis is on providing practical skills in software testing currently used in
industry. To that end, it will cover: manual and automated tests, test-driven
development, performance testing, and model checking.

This lecture will use the _blended classroom_ learning model.  All lectures
(except the guest lecture) will be pre-recorded and posted on Canvas.  It is
your responsibility to keep up with the lectures according to the schedule on
the [Syllabus](syllabus.md).  There will be 5 in-class exercises to apply
what you learned during the lectures and to prepare you for the deliverables.

You _are_ required to attend lecture days with in-class exercises and the guest
lecture marked as \[Required class\](see [Syllabus](syllabus.md)).  And of course the days with the exams.

You are _not_ required to attend lecture days with lecture Q&As or reviews
marked as \[Optional class\].

## Grading

* Projects (70%):
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 15%
  * Deliverable 3 - 15%
  * Deliverable 4 - 10%
  * Deliverable 5 - 20%
* Midterms (20%):
  * Midterm 1 - 10%
  * Midterm 2 - 10%
* Participation / TopHat Questions (10%)

Attendance will be taken on days with required classes using TopHat and will
count towards your participation score.

TopHat questions will be provided when the recorded lectures are released.
They are expected to be completed during the given time frame (during the week
the lectures are listed on the syllabus).

Exams will NOT be allowed to be made up except with a valid and verified excuse
(generally medical - others are left to the discretion of the instructor).

The following grading scale will be used.  Note that I generally do _not_ round
grades up.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-93.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
92.99-90.00  | A-
89.99-87.00  | B+
86.99-83.00  | B
82.99-80.00  | B-
79.99-77.00  | C+
76.99-73.00  | C
72.99-70.00  | C-
69.99-67.00  | D+
66.99-63.00  | D
62.99-60.00  | D-
59.99-0.00   | F

## Assignment submission

All assignments will be submitted using GradeScope.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub to _a private repository_
and then submitted to GradeScope.  Some assignments also require write-ups that
needs to be submitted to GradeScope.  The format of the write-up will be
specified on each assignment.  Students are encourged to commit early and often
to the GitHub repository as commit history will be used as the ground truth for
proof of work (especially as it relates to a group project).  Also, frequent
commits help avoid conflicts when working on the same files as your partner.  

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground
truth".  For example, if Partner A insists that they did all the work, but
GitHub history shows only commits by Partner B, I will assume that Partner B
has done all the work.

Late assignments will receive a -5 percentage point penalty per day (e.g., if
you would have received a 90% on an assignment, but you turned it in 3 days
late, you would receive 90 - 15 = 75%.).  

## Group Work

Please submit this [Partnership Contract](partnership_contract.txt) to
GradeScope by 5/18.  Your expectations as a group member are outlined clearly
on the contract.  You may resubmit the contract at a later time, at which time
the new contract will come into effect.

## Project Details

* **Deliverable 1:** Developing a test plan and traceability matrix for a system.
* **Deliverable 2:** Developing unit tests for a console-based application.
* **Deliverable 3:** Developing a simple web application system with the help of automated systems testing.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing and optimization of an application.
* **Deliverable 5:** Developing and testing an application using both static and dynamic testing.

## Programming Language Selection

For all deliverables, the class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium).  Projects written in other languages or using alternative frameworks will not be accepted.

## Participating in Class

Questions and comments are invited and strongly encouraged.  If you have a view
point or experience that may enrich the class, please jump in!  There are
several ways you can participate:

1. Online (during a Microsoft Teams meeting)

    You can either unmute your mic and interject, or type a question on the
chat window.

2. Offline

    You can post a question on the "Lecture Q & A" thread on the Canvas Discussions
board.  Individual threads for each deliverable will be created as they are
released.

    If it is not a comment specific to lectures or deliverables but just a message
you wanted to broadcast to the entire class (e.g. "I'm looking for a project
partner"), you can use Microsoft Teams.  Select the "Teams" menu item on the
left and select the "CS 1632 Software Quality Assurance" team, then post the
message on the "Posts" tab.

    You can also DM (direct message) me or another student in the class.  Again,
select the "Teams" menu and then "CS 1632 Software Quality Assurance" and then
select the "..." context menu beside the "CS 1632 Software Quality Assurance"
team name.  Please select the top-most item: "Manage Team".  There, you should
be able to see the statuses of all students in the class, and if you hover over
the name of any student, you should see options to initiate a chat, email, or a
call with that individual.

3. Email

    For most questions, you are encouraged to use one of the above methods, so that
your peers can participate and benefit from your questions.  For questions,
that are specific to your deliverable submission, please use my email.  When
you ask a question, please submit your source code to GradeScope so that I can
reproduce your error.  Also, describe precisely the steps I should take to
reproduce your error.  Before you do this, it is very hard for me to help you.

I will try to get back to all offline and email communications within 24 hours
of receipt.  Even if I'm logged into Teams, please understand that I may be
away from my desk or working on something else.  I will get back to you within
one day at the very least if you leave me a chat message, but don't always
expect an immediate reply outside of lectures and office hours.

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to, tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in 216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements, DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing information."

The instructor will work to the best of their ability to accommodate any issues arising from a disability that a student has, but he must be aware of it in order to accommodate it.  Please inform me as soon as possible if you have a disability which you think may hinder your success in the course and we (along with the DRS) should be able to work around it.

## Academic Integrity Statement

Cheating/plagiarism will _not_ be tolerated. Students suspected of violating
the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February
1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate
Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as
initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the exam or
assignment will be imposed.

View the complete policy at www.cfo.pitt.edu/policies/policy/02/02-03-02.html.

Some guidelines:

_1. For all graded assignments and exams, viewing the work done by your classmates (or a 3rd source) before submission is considered cheating.  Aiding this activity is also considered cheating.  The only exception is your designated group members for your group projects._

_2. For ungraded in-class exercises, you are allowed (and encouraged) to look at your classmates' work and discuss it.  If you get ample help for the exercises, you should rarely need additional help for the projects._

_3. If you need additional help for the projects, your best source is your instructor._
